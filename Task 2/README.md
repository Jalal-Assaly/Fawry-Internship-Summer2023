3. OrderProcessor: A class to handle order processing. It should have a placeOrder method. Print the order details (each item and price) and total cost for the cart.
4. Main: the root class that containing the main method. Create some sample products and a shopping cart. Add products to the cart, and then display the total cost. Finally, create an instance of OrderProcessor and use it to place the order, which will print the order details.
